# Martian Weight

In case you've ever pondered how much you weight on Mars, here's the calculation:

Wm = We* 0.378

where 'Wm' is the weight on Mars, and 'We' is the weight on Earth

Write a command line program which accepts a series of Earth weights from the user
and displays each Earth weight as itself, and its Martian equivalent.
